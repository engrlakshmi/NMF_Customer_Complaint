              "11    XXXX XXXX has called me from Midwest XXXX agencies. I have spoke with him and tried to settle the debt but he wouldnt give me accurate information. The numbers just do not add up. He also contacted my previous employer as well as my current employer and my girlfriend harrassing us. I have told them repeatedly i am on the national do not call registry and he still continues to call. He told my boss information that was private and hurt my employment which eventually lead to me having to leave the company. I am sick and tired of being harrassed by this same individual. He used profane language on the phone calls and calls me at least once every other day. I have tried to settle debt with the original collector and they will not accept any form of payment if it isnt the full amount.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
              "14    I received in the mail a US Bank ReliaCard Debit card in the mail. Never solicited for it. I called the phone number and discovered its for unemployment insurance payment. I called XXXX to have the card deactivated. I was on hold for 2 hrs before reaching an agent XXXX located in XXXX, Florida. I advised I never filed a claim for unemployment. She deactivated the card, she advised she will mail me paperwork showing the card is deactivated. XXXX advised me to file a Police Report, file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, file reports of fraud with the 3 credit bureau 's and call the Colorado Unemployment and get the case closed on my name. I have a very unusual last name XXXX. I'm the only one in Colorado!! I will do some of this today and the rest I will have to do on Monday with phone calls. \\nI called the XXXX County Sheriff 's Department to file a Police Report it is CT XXXX with Officer XXXX Badge # XXXX. He informed me that these people can be anywhere and to file a report with this agency as well. \\nI did not activate the card, I refused to give the last 4 digits or confirm my phone number. The card was never activated. I am a Federal Worker for USPS, I know there was a breach a few years back on our information.

A man named XXXX reached out to me in 2018 and at that time the amount he wanted me to pay was already more than double what I owed to the hospital. I questioned the amount, asked for explanations from their company, and asked for confirmation of the specific amount the hospital was saying I owed as I was willing to work out something to pay what I actually owed, and he was incredibly rude and aggressive. He was unwilling to work with me would not accept a payment for the amount owed, and made threats about ruining my credit. I did not speak with him or anyone in the company again because I felt very uncomfortable talking to them. Since then, I've received nothing from the company in regards to this debt and they just continue to increase the amount. My last statement from the hospital was that I had owed them {$1700.00} and the collection agency is reporting that I owe almost {$10000.00}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

              "7965  On Monday XX/XX/XXXX I chatted with Citibank and requested three stop pays on payday loans for XX/XX/XXXXXX/XX/XXXX. I received verification of the stop pays in the mail. On XX/XX/XXXX they posted. I messaged them again on XXXX to inquire about them and was not given a response as to why the stop pays werent honored. Instead, they asked me if I had revoked the debits and I said yes. They told me that they would open a dispute and it would be settled within 10 days. In the meantime, they have been charging overdrafts and returning items! I had also asked that they stop and further ach debits from my account. This is not happening. I want the items returned and any overdraft fees reversed as this was their error and not mine. This is not the first time theyve not honored a stop pay.

              "7966  On XX/XX/2020 my bank, XXXX XXXX, sent a check for {$16000.00} to pay down our HELOC balance close to XXXX. Specialized Loan Servicing sat on the check, then returned it to me on XX/XX/XXXX, thinking that it was a loan payoff for a traditional mortgage. Two customer service representatives acknowledged the company 's mistake and agreed to a credit of {$150.00} in interest that I should not have paid due to the delay. \\nI have spoken to customer service five times over the last six weeks ( several hours on the phone in total ) and each time they promise to refer my case to a supervisor and call me back. No one has every called me back, and the issue is still unresolved. On XX/XX/XXXX, the customer service representative told me that the HELOC department does not have a supervisor, so there isn't anyone to review the credit request. \\nPlease help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

              "7980  I was charged multiple late fees and interest charges to my Citi Cards account during the time that COVID-19 caused disruptions to businesses and to lives around the world! \\n\\nThis matter began in XX/XX/2020 when I received a call from a Citi Cards representative stating that I missed a payment. I informed the representative that I did not recall using the card referenced and requested additional information on the charges so I could validate they were legitimate charges. The representative informed me that he was unable to see details but would transfer me to customer service who could assist me, which he immediately transferred me but a representative NEVER answered and the call and then I was disconnected. I tried calling several times thereafter ( days and weeks later ) and collection representative called me but customer service was not available, not even through the online chat portal. \\n\\nI eventually spoke with a professional representative who was extremely helpful in providing details of the charges, which was all I needed to pay the bill. In addition, he offered to credit late charges due to credit/payment history and the inconvenience but all of his attempts to credit the charges failed. The representative explained that the system would not allow him to apply the credit because my account was closed. I placed many calls after that call to have the late fees removed and resolve the delinquency but continuously experienced the same outcome, even with a supervisor. \\n\\nI paid the bill minus late charges. I was, and continue to be, in utter disbelief that during the time of a world-wide pandemic ( COVID-19 ), a company could be so insensitive to close a consumers account and continue assessing late fees knowing that CITI offices were closed, or operating on limited scheduling, reduced staffing, or whatever the reason may have been for not servicing customers! \\n\\nI had great credit prior to this matter, but Citi Cards has tarnished my credit and continues to do so monthly.\\n\\nI wrote a complaint to multiple executives of the Citi Cards team and was told that charges would not be reversed because the payment was late - without acknowledging their lack of service to customers in previous months.   \n",

I informed the representative that I did not recall using the card referenced and requested additional information on the charges so I could validate they were legitimate charges. The representative informed me that he was unable to see details but would transfer me to customer service who could assist me, which he immediately transferred me but a representative NEVER answered and the call and then I was disconnected. I tried calling several times thereafter ( days and weeks later ) and collection representative called me but customer service was not available, not even through the online chat portal. \\n\\nI eventually spoke with a professional representative who was extremely helpful in providing details of the charges, which was all I needed to pay the bill. In addition, he offered to credit late charges due to credit/payment history and the inconvenience but all of his attempts to credit the charges failed. The representative explained that the system would not allow him to apply the credit because my account was closed. I placed many calls after that call to have the late fees removed and resolve the delinquency but continuously experienced the same outcome, even with a supervisor. \\n\\nI paid the bill minus late charges. I was, and continue to be, in utter disbelief that during the time of a world-wide pandemic ( COVID-19 ), a company could be so insensitive to close a consumers account and continue assessing late fees knowing that CITI offices were closed, or operating on limited scheduling, reduced staffing, or whatever the reason may have been for not servicing customers! \\n\\nI had great credit prior to this matter, but Citi Cards has tarnished my credit and continues to do so monthly.\\n\\nI wrote a complaint to multiple executives of the Citi Cards team and was told that charges would not be reversed because the payment was late - without acknowledging their lack of service to customers in previous months.</td>\n",

              "11    XXXX XXXX has called me from Midwest XXXX agencies. I have spoke with him and tried to settle the debt but he wouldnt give me accurate information. The numbers just do not add up. He also contacted my previous employer as well as my current employer and my girlfriend harrassing us. I have told them repeatedly i am on the national do not call registry and he still continues to call. He told my boss information that was private and hurt my employment which eventually lead to me having to leave the company. I am sick and tired of being harrassed by this same individual. He used profane language on the phone calls and calls me at least once every other day. I have tried to settle debt with the original collector and they will not accept any form of payment if it isnt the full amount.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
              "14    I received in the mail a US Bank ReliaCard Debit card in the mail. Never solicited for it. I called the phone number and discovered its for unemployment insurance payment. I called XXXX to have the card deactivated. I was on hold for 2 hrs before reaching an agent XXXX located in XXXX, Florida. I advised I never filed a claim for unemployment. She deactivated the card, she advised she will mail me paperwork showing the card is deactivated. XXXX advised me to file a Police Report, file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, file reports of fraud with the 3 credit bureau 's and call the Colorado Unemployment and get the case closed on my name. I have a very unusual last name XXXX. I'm the only one in Colorado!! I will do some of this today and the rest I will have to do on Monday with phone calls. \\nI called the XXXX County Sheriff 's Department to file a Police Report it is CT XXXX with Officer XXXX Badge # XXXX. He informed me that these people can be anywhere and to file a report with this agency as well. \\nI did not activate the card, I refused to give the last 4 digits or confirm my phone number. The card was never activated. I am a Federal Worker for USPS, I know there was a breach a few years back on our information. I will be enrolling in XXXX as well for my protection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
              "16    In response to complaint XXXX : US Bank agreed to waive all late fees that had been applied to my account. I was assured this would be corrected by Thursday, XXXX.

              "38    Voss and Klein, on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, is reporting an astronomical amount of debt on my credit report that they are constantly increasing by almost {$100.00} every couple weeks without sending me anything at all in regards to this debt. A man named XXXX reached out to me in 2018 and at that time the amount he wanted me to pay was already more than double what I owed to the hospital. I questioned the amount, asked for explanations from their company, and asked for confirmation of the specific amount the hospital was saying I owed as I was willing to work out something to pay what I actually owed, and he was incredibly rude and aggressive. He was unwilling to work with me would not accept a payment for the amount owed, and made threats about ruining my credit. I did not speak with him or anyone in the company again because I felt very uncomfortable talking to them. Since then, I've received nothing from the company in regards to this debt and they just continue to increase the amount. My last statement from the hospital was that I had owed them {$1700.00} and the collection agency is reporting that I owe almost {$10000.00}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

              "7965  On Monday XX/XX/XXXX I chatted with Citibank and requested three stop pays on payday loans for XX/XX/XXXXXX/XX/XXXX. I received verification of the stop pays in the mail. On XX/XX/XXXX they posted. I messaged them again on XXXX to inquire about them and was not given a response as to why the stop pays werent honored. Instead, they asked me if I had revoked the debits and I said yes. They told me that they would open a dispute and it would be settled within 10 days. In the meantime, they have been charging overdrafts and returning items! I had also asked that they stop and further ach debits from my account. This is not happening. I want the items returned and any overdraft fees reversed as this was their error and not mine. This is not the first time theyve not honored a stop pay.
