# Customer Complaint Analysis using NMF Technique (NLP)
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a technique commonly used for topic modeling and dimensionality reduction in natural language processing (NLP). It can be applied to analyze customer complaints to identify underlying topics and patterns within the complaints. Here's a general outline of how you can perform customer complaint analysis using the NMF technique in Python:
1. Data Preprocessing:Load and preprocess your customer complaint data. This involves tasks such as text cleaning, tokenization, lowercase, and removing stop words.
Create a document-term matrix (DTM) where each row corresponds to a complaint and each column corresponds to a unique word in the corpus.
2. Apply NMF:Import the necessary libraries, such as sklearn for NMF implementation. Choose the number of topics (n_components) you want to extract from the complaints. This is a hyperparameter and may require experimentation. Initialize and fit the NMF model to your document-term matrix (DTM).
3. Extract Topics: Retrieve the learned topic-word matrix and document-topic matrix from the NMF model. Display the top words for each topic and examine the topics to assign meaningful labels.
4. Assign Topics to Complaints:
Identify the most relevant topic for each customer complaint using the document-topic matrix.
You can either assign the topic with the highest value or set a threshold to consider multiple topics.
5. Analyze and interpret the identified topics to gain insights into the main issues customers are complaining about.
